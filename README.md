# Meteor Shower

[Meteor Shower](#) is part of a Turing School of Software and Design group [project](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown) with a focus on client-side design and test-driven development. The game was built using [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) and [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas) frameworks.

## Local Implementation
With [node](https://nodejs.org/en/), users can also install the game locally with the following commands:

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To fire up a development server:

```
npm start
```

Once the server is running, you can visit:

* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` to run the game.
* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/test.html` to run test suite in the browser.
